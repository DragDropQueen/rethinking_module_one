Rachelâ€™s Thoughts on Module 1

**Problems**

- some students are missing fundamental syntax skills
- some students are missing algorithmic thinking skills
- some students have trouble translating an algorithm to code

**Potential solutions**

Differentiation
	- choice between prep materials: Pragmatic, Codecademy Ruby track, CodeSchool Try Ruby
	- instructor-guided classes vs. on own tutorials for intro material (first two weeks)
	- identify students who struggle in first week and set up daily 30-minute one-on-one sessions for duration of first module.

Expand Ruby in 100 Minutes
	- break into three morning sessions
	- session 1: variables, strings, symbols, numbers, nil/nothingness
	- session 2: arrays, hashes, blocks, conditionals
	- session 3: objects, attributes, methods
	- for each session: 1.5 hrs of instruction, 1.5 hours of practice exercises

Daily algorithmic thinking practice
	- 30 minutes per day
	- instructor-guided for first two weeks so students can see process of breaking stuff down

Daily skill drills
	- 15 minutes per day for skill drills on Ruby in 100 minutes fundamentals

Scrap giant repos
 	- enumerables repo
	- objects and methods repo
	- command and query repo

Make Fridays skill-based
	- especially for module one, I think Fridays need to include more practice

Build CSV phone book exercise as a class
	- tutorial is too long and confusing

Make Mastermind, and event reporter more guided
	- daily assignments for pieces to build, then review as a class w/instructor

Cut down completion time of Sales Engine
 	- assign pieces to work on for each day

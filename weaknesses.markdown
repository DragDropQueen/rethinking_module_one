## Weaknesses in Past Modules 1

Students struggle to...

* break down problems into algorithms
* implement algorithms in code
* identify fragments of code as objects, instances, methods, etc
* isolate the simplest possible case, then spiral up
* feel like they're making progress (need microwins)
* make good use of pair programming
* manage their project development / iteration
* understand how data is passed and transformed across operations
* create mental models of arrays, hashes, etc
